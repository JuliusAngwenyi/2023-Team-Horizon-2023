1.	Best Enhancement to XM Cloud

# Our Solution Summary

- Latest Sitecore 10.3 and XM Cloud introduced a new management and administration APIs and webhooks capabilities. Our hackathon idea is to develop best enhancement to XM Cloud leveraging the new webhooks capabilities. Our fictitious global marketing company, Horizon has faced challenges managing the transcreation of our global content to all our markets. 
- Globa, our global content producer needs to assign content transcreation orders efficiently, notify her team to action, translate content to various localized languages to meet our business needs. 
- Nicola, the localization specialist needs to leverage modern AI tooling to help with transcreation process efficiently to meet tight deadlines. 
- Rupet, our reporting guru loves visibility and wants to communicate with global campaign managers on transcreation orders. 
- Brenda, our marketing brand manager wants content available to omni-channels for all locales to meet global demands.

# Solution Design

1.	We leverage the Sitecore XM webhooks functionality to trigger transcreation work orders raised by Globa, our global content producer. She does this by creating new versions, in Sitecore XM, of content for different languages to meet global needs.  
2.	Our Notifications Hub will process the webhooks from Sitecore XM using Serverless Functions hosted on our managed Azure cloud. This will push direct messages and notifications to our team of transcreation analysts, lead by Nicola. 
3.	It also logs all transcreation orders in Cosmos DB repository, which acts as store tracking changes done during transcreation processes and content strategy workflows. 
4.	We have a JamStack web portal which Nicola and her team will use to pick the logged transcreation orders, proces them through agreed workflows. 
5.	We leverage the Open AI API integration to efficiently localize and translate content as per the requests. All approved content will then be fed back into Sitecore XM Cloud using the REST APIs 
6.	Brenda will then work with Globa to review the final content in XM Cloud, publish this to a global CDN (Sitecore Delivery Platform) to meet the omni-channel needs for our business
